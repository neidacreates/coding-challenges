'''
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.


Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.


Constraints:

    1 <= prices.length <= 105
    0 <= prices[i] <= 104

# APPROACH
# two pointers
# make a left and right pointer, set left to 0 and right to 1
# set profit to 0
# the right pointer moves faster than the left
# left pointer only moves if the left value is greater than the right, but right keeps moving every round, to check the next number until the end of the list
# every time the right moves, before it does, set profit to greatest value
# if we found a smaller value on the right, left pointer will move to become that value
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, 1
        profit = 0 
        while right < len(prices):
            if prices[left] < prices[right]:
                new_profit = prices[right]-prices[left]
                profit = max(profit, new_profit)
            else:
                left = right
            right += 1
        return profit
    
# SAMPLE SOLUTION
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        
        lowest = prices[0]
        for price in prices:
            if price < lowest:
                lowest = price
            res = max(res, price - lowest)
        return res
